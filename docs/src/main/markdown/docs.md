# Documentation

## Structure

When we're learning about a particular concept or feature we should get most of the questions we have answered at first glance.
Documentation regarding features and concepts should be easy to find as well as the features that introduced them and examples of their use.

To ensure that Serpentes is easy to learn we define a flow from requirements, to features, to concepts.
The documentation captures each of these aspects in the following structure:

- Requirements
  - Type
  - Rationale
- Features
  - Tag(s)
  - Associated concepts
  - Associated requirements
  - Associated feature-request
  - Associated examples
  - Sub-features
  - Rationale
- Concepts
  - Associated features
  - Associated concepts
  - Associated requirements

Here each of the main aspects defines a set of sub-aspects that the documentation should/will cover.
Take note that Serpentes is still in its prototypical phase and documentation is unfinished.
