# Roadmap
Below you can find a listing of goals. 
These goals are not time-bound due to the fact I work on this project alone and in my spare-time.
The goals are ordered by priority and are non-extensive:

1. Release prototype.
1. Retrieve feedback on the prototype.
1. Scrap the prototype.
1. Incorporate feedback into the design where necessary.
1. Incorporate build-system.
1. Rebuild with tests covering unhappy flow and remove duplication.
1. Expand number of examples.
1. Release alpha-version.
1. Expand type-definition support.
1. Avoid Serpentes configuration bean bleed-through.
1. Release beta-version.
1. Introduce library configuration specifications.
1. Start RC-version releases.
1. Ensure API is stable.
1. Release 1.0.0.
